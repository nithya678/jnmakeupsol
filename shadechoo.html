            <h3>How to find your skin tone</h3>
            <p>
                Skin tones are split into three main categories â€“ Light, medium and deep. 
                In the global context, Indians, largely, have medium skin tone irrespective of the region
                we hail from. Light skin tone typically is reflective of Caucasians while deep is for Africans.
                Medium skin tone can be further sub-divided into beige, tan, honey and more such colors. Refer to the 
                infographic below and find the skin tone closest to yours.

        <h3>How to identify your skin undertone</h3>    
        <img src="img/shade2.jpg" alt="How to identify your skin undertone" style="width:50%;height:50%;margin-left: 250px;">
        <p>Skin undertone refers to the color that comes through the skin from underneath its surface.
            Skin undertones are of three types â€“ warm, neutral and cool. To identify your skin undertone, 
            here are a few tests you can try:</p>

        <p><b>1.</b> The wrist test: Check the color of your veins. If they are purple or blue in color then you 
                are cool. If they are green or olive in color, you are warm. But if you are unable to determine
                the dominant color, you are neutral.</p>

        <p><b>2.</b> The sun test: If your skin turns red when you are out in the sun, you have cool undertone. 
            Conversely, if you get tanned easily in the sun you have warm undertone.</p>
        
        <h3>How to choose foundation shade from swatches</h3>
                <img src="img/shade3.jpg" alt="How to identify your skin undertone" style="width:50%;height:50%;margin-left: 250px;">
                <p>Once you know skin color and undertone, your search for the right foundation shade narrows 
                        down considerably. You will, most likely, by now have a handful of foundations shades 
                        to choose from. In such a scenario itâ€™s best to test the shades on your skin and find 
                        the perfect match.</p>

                        <p>Start by shortlisting three shades that seem to be a good match. 
                            Then, dab some of each shade as short lines on your jaw line 
                            (do keep some space in between each). Donâ€™t just consider your 
                            face for making the final decision but also your neck. 
                            The foundation you choose should blend seamlessly with both your face and 
                            your neck.</p>  
                        <h3>How to determine which foundation shade looks best</h3>
                        <p>Of the three swatches, remove the two that donâ€™t suit you. Now, spread the finalised
                            shade across your jawline, and sweep a cotton bud soaked in makeup remover right 
                            in the middle. If you donâ€™t notice any difference between your foundation and bare 
                            skin, then thatâ€™s the foundation for you. But, if you see a difference between the 
                            two, this shade is not for you. Repeat the cycle till you find the shade you are
                            looking for.</p>
