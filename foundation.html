        <h2>Foundation is a type of skin-colored makeup that, when applied, makes your face 
        appear clean and uniform. Liquid foundation is one of the most popular forms of 
        foundation because itâ€™s easy to use and offers great coverage.</h2>

        <h3>POUR A DIME-SIZED AMOUNT OF FOUNDATION.</h3>
        <p>Into your palette of choice. 
            You can either use the back of your hand, a small
            dish, or even a folded up napkin. Don't pour out too much. 
            You can always add more later.</p>

        <h3>DIP YOUR FINGERS.</h3>
        <p>Into the foundation, and begin to dab it onto your face. 
            Start with two dabs on your forehead, two on each cheek, one on your nose, 
            and one on your chin. A little goes a long way with liquid foundation,
            and you can always add more to areas that need additional coverage.</p>

        <h3>USE YOUR FINGERTIPS TO BLEND.</h3>
        <p>the foundation into your skin. Use either a 
            patting/tapping motion with just the pads of your fingers, or make small,
            light circles with your fingertips. Begin with the areas that tend to have 
            the most uneven skin tone (nose, cheeks, and forehead for most people) and 
            work out from there</p>
        <P>
----Make sure your circular motions are in an upward direction rather than a downward one. 
Pulling the skin downwards can cause your skin to sag over time.</p>
        <P>
----Think about blending the foundation lightly, not rubbing it in, and definitely not
"slathering" it on.</p><P>
----If you need more coverage, add more foundation to your face a dab at a time.</p><P>
----When using your fingertips to apply foundation, the heat from your fingers
will melt it before application. This is great if you are looking for less coverage.
If you are going for a full-coverage look, use a generous amount of powder to set 
it afterwards.</p>

        <h3>BLEND YOUR EDGES.</h3> 
        <p>Blend your foundation carefully into your jawline, hairline,
            and around your ears to avoid leaving distinct lines.</p><P>
----If you have a sponge, use it to blend the foundation at your jawline using short downward 
strokes.</p><P>
----If you notice a distinct color change at the jawline, you may need a different shade
of foundation. It is normal for your face to be a little lighter than the rest of your body.
If you find that your foundation is a little too light, you can blend it down to your neck.
You can also try using a darker powder on top.</p>

        <h3>SET UP YOUR FOUNDATION.</h3> <p>
       Wait 2-3 minutes for foundation to dry. If it is still
            noticeably moist, blot your face gently with a tissue. 
            Apply other makeup, and then set your foundation with a translucent finishing powder. 
            Apply the powder gently with a puff, and your makeup will last all day.
